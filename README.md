## Installing

DRAMSpec requires some libraries from [boost](http://www.boost.org/). If you do not have it or the version you have is older than the 1.58, please follow the first four (4) steps from their [getting started](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html) section.

### Cloning from github (recursive to get submodules!)
``` bash
    git clone --recursive <URL>
```

### Building DRAMSpec

1. To be sure DRAMSpec repository was properly cloned, build and run the program in test mode:

``` bash
    ./runTests.sh
```

2. After getting the "No errors detected" message, you are ready to build DRAMSpec itself. To do that, simply run the [buildDRAMSpec.sh](buildDRAMSpec.sh) script:

``` bash
    ./buildDRAMSpec.sh
```

The executable is now available under `build/release/` by the name `dramspec`.

### Running DRAMSpec

The program expect as parameters (at least) one technology and one achitecture description files. The flags `-t` and `-p` precede the technology and architecture description files, respectively. The optional `-term` flag will include the IO termination currents for read and write operations of the DRAM.

``` bash
    ./build/release/dramspec -t <path/to/technologyfilename> -p <path/to/parameterfilename> [-term]
```

#### Examples:

``` bash
    ./build/release/dramspec -t technology_input/techddr3_5x.json -p architecture_input/parddr3.json
```

It is also possible to run multiple input files at once:

``` bash
    ./build/release/dramspec -t <t1.json> <t2.json> -p <p1.json> <p1.json> [-term]
```
Note: the number of technology and architecture description files must be equal.
